1.  I have Commissioned 6 [`robotic parking systems`](https://www.otomatik.com.tr/_FILES/Contents/1560/project_report_izmir_en.pdf?v=20240706180911){:target="_blank"} with lifts, conveyors, and turntables, and 9 [`semi-automatic stacked car parking`](https://www.otomatik.com.tr/_FILES/Contents/2583/parkolay_datasheet_parkonfor111_pt_en.pdf?v=20240706180911){:target="_blank"} systems with hydraulics in Turkey, USA, Dubai, Australia, and Israel.
2. As an Interdepartmental Site Supervisor, I led mechanical and electrical teams for the installation and commissioning of equipment, ensuring compliance with safety and quality standards of facilities and plants on the client's site. 
3.  I collaborated with internal teams to guarantee client satisfaction by establishing and nurturing lasting relationships with customers via [`CRM`](https://www.ifs.com/solutions/capabilities/customer-relationship-management){:target="_blank"} and [`ERP`](https://www.ifs.com/solutions/enterprise-resource-planning) systems.
4.  Provided on-site and remote assistance for system debugging, troubleshooting and maintenance.
5.  Programming on PLCs of `SIMATIC S7-1200` using TIA Portal and `Allen-Bradley FLEX 5000` using RSLogix 5000 for robotic car parking system. For the semi-automatic car parking system the Lenze and `GMT` PLCs have been utilized. 
6.  Completed projects including [`AGV`](https://www.elmomc.com/industries/agv/){:target="_blank"}  (Autonomous Guided Vehicles), [`Object detection scanner`](https://www.sick.com/br/en/catalog/products/lidar-and-radar-sensors/lidar-sensors/lms1xx/lms111-10100/p/p109842){:target="_blank"}, `Payment Management with Park Assist system`.
7.  Worked on `motion axis control` for motors to increase the torque by operating on 87Hz using inverters and drivers. I utilized optical transceiver `Leuze DDLS 200` for optic communication and integrated the `SICK safety controllers` and `scanners` for safe operation and monitoring.
8.  Planned and implemented electrical systems such as circuit layouts, wiring diagrams, and equipment specifications and panels on `solidwork` 
9.  Demonstrated proficiency in `EtherNet`, `PROFINET`, `ModBus Rs485 and RS-232`, `CANopen DS402`.

üïß __16.02.2021 ‚Äì 27.03.2022__

1. Programmed PLCs using structured text and ladder logic. Developed a cross-platform SCADA program in `Python` with OPC UA, `JavaScript`, `Docker`, `PostgreSQL`, and `SQLite3` to configure and monitor large-scale systems. Developed program efficiently take decision and operate the parking robot by adopting short path to reduce park-in and park-out duration with less consumption of energy. 
2. Developed program and FDI server using OPC-UA to access the real-time data of field devices for integration of non-native field protocols and integrated with devices in heterogeneous hierarchical networks. 
3. Developed a `SCADA` system with user interface using `HTML`, `JavaScript`, and 3D modeling with `BabylonJS` for illustration of real-time data and visual demonstration of system control. The user interface functions as an HMI, displaying the entire process and facility in composition of 3D model on a single page application. 
4. The developed the program which enabled the dynamic versatile functions to send commands and read/write multiple parameters of PLCs and DCS using Python via OPC UA with multithreaded processing. 
5. Used cloud storage and `PostgreSQL` to store and configure the PLCs. The backup data and logs are stored in local disk in the form of `SQLite` database. Deployed the application to multiple remote systems and computing environments using Docker.
6. Completed projects including `License Plate Recognition using image processing`,  HMI development on¬†Raspberry Pi (Linux), program to operate semi-automatic car parking system via `Bluetooth` remote control, and `RFID` card authentication for vehicle parking and retrieval.

üìç_[Pakistan Railways](https://www.railways.gov.pk/){:target="_blank"} /Rawalpindi_

üïß _22.06.2016 - 18.07.2018_

1. Worked in the automation of two `350 KVA` generator sets for electric load balancing to reduce the running cost and improve the efficiency using Siemens `SIMATIC S7-S1200` PLC programmed on TIA Portal using Schneider electric appliances.
2. Revision in the program for safe operation of bending and tamping machines with `ST programming` on Delta PLC with `Codesys 3.5` controlled by various digital and analog sensors like loadcells, pneumatic values, and hydraulic systems.
3. Designed and program a spring manufacturing machine operated by Delta servo motors and drivers with `CANopen` communication.
4. Installed PLC and electric panels for the train wagon manufacturing plant operated by asynchronous motors and servo motors with encoder by Delta, and Danfoss drivers.
5. Designed and installed a control system for safe operations of generators and implemented automation solutions using `Schneider` and `EATON` electric components.
6. Prepared electric plans and P&ID diagrams on `EPLAN`.
7. Prepared and calculated Project Costs, Construction costs, Operation & Maintenance costs, Procurement Costs, and Installation Cost reports.
